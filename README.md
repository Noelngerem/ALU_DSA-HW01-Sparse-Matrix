# Sparse Matrix Operations

Good  Day Mr David, this is the corrected version of my program and how to run it successfully.

This project implements a **Sparse Matrix** data structure and supports **addition, subtraction, and multiplication** of sparse matrices.



### Run the Program:

To run the program,
`cd SparseMatrix-Operations`
Then run:
`python main.py`


### Follow the On-Screen Prompts:

- Enter the path of the first and second matrix files (e.g., `matrixfile1.txt`).
- Choose an operation: **Addition (+), Subtraction (-), or Multiplication (*)**.
- Enter the output file name (e.g., `result_add.txt`).
- The computed matrix will be saved to the specified file.

## Example Run:


Sparse Matrix Operations

Enter path for first matrix: matrixfile1.txt

Enter path for second matrix: matrixfile2.txt

Choose an operation:

1. Addition (+)

2. Subtraction (-)

3. Multiplication (*)

Enter choice (1/2/3): 1

Enter output file name: result_add.txt

Addition successful!

Result saved to result_add.txt
